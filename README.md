## For Developers
Each branch is there for a purpose:
* master: The main branch; General bug fixes and feature updates are pushed here.
* dev: For experimental feature developments.
* stable: Only contains the version with minimal errors.
* hellworld: Only used once in the beginning; it is just a testing branch for an initial setup for Android Studio with a rudimentary 'hello world' project.
