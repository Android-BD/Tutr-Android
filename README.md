## For Developers
Each branch is there for a purpose:
* master: The main branch; General bug fixes and feature updates are pushed here.
* stable: Only contains the version with minimal errors.

-- It is always recommended to branch out from the most recent master whenever building a new feature or fixing bugs and return to master as soon as it is done in order to reduce merge conflicts.
